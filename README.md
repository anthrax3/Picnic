# Picnic
Picnic is a .NET Core CMS Extension for ASP.NET MVC Web Applications


## Why Another CMS System?
Most of the existing content platforms and frameworks available are either too complicated, too restricted, or not easily used alongside an existing application.  When you have a simple app that requires content management and you don't want to invest in new technology, Picnic saves the day.


## What is it?
Picnic is a .NET Core class library offering simple CMS functionality along with an embedded management interface.  Simply install the package, add a few lines of configuration, and your app is content enabled.  

### Ok, but what does it do?
It allows you to effortlessly create, manage and render both dynamic pages and inline content.

## Getting Started

#### Step 1: Add Some Usings to your Startup.cs
```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.FileProviders;
using Picnic.Controllers;
using Picnic.Extensions;
```

#### Step 2: Specify Store and Wire up Picnic's Views
```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{            
    //...Existing configuration

    // Add Picnic and Specify Json Store
    services.AddPicnic().UseJsonStore("App_Data");

    // Configure the Auth Policy
    services.AddAuthorization(options => options.AddPolicy("PicnicAuthPolicy", policyOptions =>
    {
        // NOTE: This example allows anonymous access to the Picnic interface
        // Add your application's policy specifics to control access to the Picnic interface
        policyOptions.RequireAssertion(x => true);
        policyOptions.Build();
    }));

    // Enables Picnic Mvc Services
    services.AddMvc().UsePicnic();
}
```

There is also an Entity Framework store that can be used like this:
```csharp
services.AddPicnic().UseEFStore<PicnicDbContext>();
```

Replace PicnicDbContext with your custom context if needed and make sure to perform other required steps to setup Entity Framework.

#### Step 3: Add the Picnic Catch-All Route for Dynamic Pages
```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
{
    //...Existing configuration

    app.UseMvc(routes =>
    {
        routes.MapRoute(
            name: "default",
            template: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");

        // Add the Picnic Catch-All Route to enable dynamic pages
        routes.AddPicnicDynamicPageRoute();
    });
}
```

#### How to Access the Admin Interface
Open a browser and go the following Url relative to your application root:
```
/picnic
```

If you want to customize the root part of the path, you can do so when you call UsePicnic() on services.AddMvc() like so:

```csharp
services.AddMvc().UsePicnic("admin/css");
```

#### How to Render Inline Content
Use the HtmlHelper extension method, Content();
```csharp
@Html.Content("YourContentKey")
```

## Where can I get it?

## Roadmap
This is a new project with many features planned, but the ultimate goal is to keep things simple.  I'll be building out the roadmap in the coming weeks.
